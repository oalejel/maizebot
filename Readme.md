# EECS 467 Maizebot project 
MAiZE Bot is a robot that solves the popular tilt labyrinth game. Labyrinth games are games in which a ball has to be moved through a maze by tilting the maze surface. The maze contains walls to mark out paths and holes that serve as traps. The player must move the ball from the starting point to the goal while avoiding the traps.

The idea for MAiZE Bot is to have two stepper motors, one attached to each knob of the labyrinth, along with an overhead camera which can observe the game. These components are attached to a processor which receives the cameraâ€™s video stream and makes decisions about the controls applied to the stepper motors to make the ball move to the goal.
